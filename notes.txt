Between late 2024 and the first half of January 2025, I took a pretty long trip to Europe to catch up with some friends. Since most of my friends are doingn their Masters in France, that was my "home base", but since I was going to be there for a while, I wanted to see as many people as possible. This meant making short trips to the UK and Switzerland during my longer stay. Within these countries, I also made quite a few trips to different cities. Armed with my EUrail pass, I was truly unstoppable. It was such a good deal -- even the Paris-London-Paris trip via Eurostar more than made up the price of the 10 day Eurrail pass.
